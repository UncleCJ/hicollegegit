# Welcome to the HiQ HiCollege repository

This is mainly used for the [Nov 2014 HiCollege course](https://wiki.hiq.se/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=47087938), but we hope for it to stay alive even after that. Because we think git is exciting, after all ;-) .

Depending on whether you see this in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/hicollegegit/developers) or [github](https://github.com/UncleCJ/hicollegit/), you're probably watching our full repository where we work, or just the single branch we wanted to publish. Or you've cloned us, how would we know? Knock yourself out!

You may want to see the [presentation](Intro_to_SCM_and_Git-presentation.pptx) or our [link list](links.md). This is [README.md](README.md).
